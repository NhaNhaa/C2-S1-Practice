    <h1>Introduction to HTML !</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the world of code! <br> 
        Last year, millions of learners from our community started with HTML.</p>
    <p>Why? <br> 
        <strong>HTML is the skeleton of all web pages.</strong> It's often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work</p>
    <p>HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as <a href="image.jpg">images</a>, text, or <a href="videos.jpg">videos</a>.</p>
